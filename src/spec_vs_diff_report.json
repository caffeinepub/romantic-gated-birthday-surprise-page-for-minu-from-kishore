  "summary": "The diff updates App UI flow and adds/adjusts romantic styling/animations, but it does not include the two requested uploaded JPEG files as new static assets, and the React references to the exact filenames cannot be verified from the truncated App.tsx content.",
  "missing_requirements": [
    {
      "id": "REQ-12",
      "requirement": "Add the two user-uploaded images (photo_2026-02-06_14-51-36.jpg and photo_2026-02-06_14-51-40.jpg) to the frontend static assets and reference them from the React app (no backend fetch).",
      "reason": "No new files were added in the diff, so the two JPEG assets are not present as newly added static files. Additionally, the truncated App.tsx prevents verifying that the exact filenames are referenced when rendering.",
